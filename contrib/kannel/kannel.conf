## SMSC smpp1 - Fake SMSC for testing sending and receiving SMS
## ================================================================================

# outgoing SMS will automatically loopback as incoming SMS with same content

# we can add other type of SMSC here

# incoming SMS will be pushed with HTTP GET to this URL, in playSMS this is callback URL for Kannel gateway plugin
get-url = "http://localhost/playsms/index.php?app=call&cat=gateway&plugin=kannel&access=geturl&t=%t&q=%q&a=%a&Q=%Q&smsc=%i"
# if your playSMS is not accessible or not running on http://localhost/playsms then use your correct playSMS URL
# for example your playSMS URL is https://example.com then your get-url would be:
# get-url = "https://example.com/index.php?app=call&cat=gateway&plugin=kannel&access=geturl&t=%t&q=%q&a=%a&Q=%Q&smsc=%i"

# successful HTTP GET from Kannel will be logged in playsms.log
# please watch playsms.log while testing
