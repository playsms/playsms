INSTALLATION
------------

There are 2 methods explained in this document to install playSMS:
1. INSTALLATION on Linux using install-script
2. INSTALLATION on Linux step by step

You should pick one, don't do both methods.

If you are using Ubuntu server, relatively fresh and not much core changes, then
I suggest you to use 1st method, using install-script.


1. INSTALLATION on Linux using install-script
---------------------------------------------

playSMS Web Interface using install script:

1.  Extract playSMS package somewhere (Usually in /usr/local/src).

    # tar -zxf playsms-1.0.0.tar.gz -C /usr/local/src
    # ls -l /usr/local/src/

2.  Edit install.conf, read it, understand it and make changes to suit your
    system configuration

    # cd /usr/local/src/playsms-1.0.0/contrib/installer
    # vi install.conf

3.  Run installer script. Be warned that the script have been tested only on 
    Ubuntu server or desktop.

    # cd /usr/local/src/playsms-1.0.0/contrib/installer
    # ./install-playsms-ubuntu.sh

    Note:
    - you must read and verify the install data presented when running
      script install-playsms-ubuntu.sh, and continue only when the data
      is correct
    - edit install.conf again if you think your install data is wrong
    - after successful installation, please run command "ps ax" and see
      if playsmsd is running

      # ps ax | grep playsms
      4069 pts/12  S    0:00 /usr/bin/php -q /usr/local/bin/playsmsd schedule
      4071 pts/12  S    0:00 /usr/bin/php -q /usr/local/bin/playsmsd dlrssmsd
      4073 pts/12  S    0:00 /usr/bin/php -q /usr/local/bin/playsmsd recvsmsd
      4075 pts/12  S    0:00 /usr/bin/php -q /usr/local/bin/playsmsd sendsmsd

      # playsmsd status

      # playsmsd check

    - stop here and review your installation steps when playsmsd is not running
    - consider to ask question in playSMS forum when you encountered a problem
    - if all seems to be correctly installed you may try to login from web

      browse http://<your web server IP>/playsms/ and login using default
      administrator user

      username: admin
      password: admin


2. INSTALLATION on Linux step by step
-------------------------------------

playSMS Web Interface step-by-step installation:

1.  Extract playSMS package somewhere (Usually in /usr/local/src).

    # tar -zxf playsms-1.0.0.tar.gz -C /usr/local/src

2.  Create playSMS web root, log, lib and set ownership to user www-data or
    web server user

    # mkdir -p /var/www/playsms /var/log/playsms /var/lib/playsms
    # chown -R www-data /var/www/playsms /var/log/playsms /var/lib/playsms

    Note: There are Linux distributions using 'apache' as web server user
          instead of 'www-data'.

3.  Copy files and directories inside 'web' directory to playSMS web root and
    set ownership again to user www-data or web server user, just to make sure

    # cp -rR /usr/local/src/playsms-1.0.0/web/* /var/www/playsms
    # chown -R www-data /var/www/playsms

4.  Setup database (import database)

    # mysqladmin -u root -p create playsms
    # mysql -u root -p playsms < /usr/local/src/playsms-1.0.0/db/playsms.sql

    Note: You don't need to use MySQL root access nor this method to setup
          playSMS database, but this is beyond our scope. You should read MySQL
          manual for custom installation method or howto insert SQL statements
          into existing database.

5.  Copy config-dist.php to config.php and then edit config.php

    # cp /var/www/playsms/config-dist.php /var/www/playsms/config.php
    # vi /var/www/playsms/config.php

    Note: Please read and fill all fields with correct values

6.  Enter daemon/linux directory, copy files and folder inside

    # cp /usr/local/src/playsms-1.0.0/daemon/linux/etc/playsms \
      /etc/playsmsd.conf
    # cp /usr/local/src/playsms-1.0.0/daemon/linux/bin/playsmsd \
      /usr/local/bin/

7.  Just to make sure every paths are correct, please edit /etc/playsmsd.conf

    # vi /etc/playsmsd.conf

    Note: Make sure that PLAYSMS_PATH is pointing to a correct playSMS
          installation path (in this example to /var/www/playsms), and also make
          sure that PLAYSMS_BIN is pointing to a correct playSMS daemon scripts
          path (in this example to /usr/local/bin)

8.  There are two choices to get playSMS daemon starts automatically on boot.
    You need to choose one:

    A. Using init script. When you are installing playSMS on Debian based distro
       (like Ubuntu), you may use contributed init script. Copy the init script
       to /etc/init.d/ and program it to start at boot

       # cp /usr/local/src/playsms-1.0.0/daemon/linux/etc/playsms.init-ubuntu \
         /etc/init.d/playsms

       # update-rc.d playsms defaults

    B. Using rc.local. Look for rc.local on /etc, /etc/init.d, /etc/rc.d/init.d
       When you found it edit that rc.local and put:

       "/usr/local/bin/playsmsd start" (without quotes, remove quotes)

       on the bottom of the file (before exit if theres an exit command).
       This way playsmsd will start automatically on boot.

    Note: Just like any other steps before, you need 'root' access to do this.

9. Start playsmsd manually, no need to reboot your OS

    A. If you are using the init script:

       # /etc/init.d/playsms start

    B. If you are using rc.local:

       # playsmsd start

    Note:
    - after finishing above installation steps, please run command "ps ax" and
      see if playsmsd is running

      # ps ax | grep playsms
      4069 pts/12  S    0:00 /usr/bin/php -q /usr/local/bin/playsmsd schedule
      4071 pts/12  S    0:00 /usr/bin/php -q /usr/local/bin/playsmsd dlrssmsd
      4073 pts/12  S    0:00 /usr/bin/php -q /usr/local/bin/playsmsd recvsmsd
      4075 pts/12  S    0:00 /usr/bin/php -q /usr/local/bin/playsmsd sendsmsd

      # playsmsd status

      # playsmsd check

    - stop here and review your installation steps when playsmsd is not running
    - consider to ask question in playSMS forum when you encountered a problem
    - if all seems to be correctly installed you may try to login from web

      browse http://<your web server IP>/playsms/ and login using default
      administrator user

      username: admin
      password: admin


GATEWAY INSTALLATION
--------------------

If you have GSM modem and plan to use it with playSMS, please continue to follow
instructions in INSTALL_SMSSERVERTOOLS to use SMS Server Tools (smstools3) as
your gateway module, or follow INSTALL_KANNEL if you want to use Kannel.

Gnokii and Gammu also supported, please follow INSTALL_GNOKII if you want to use
Gnokii as your gateway module, or INSTALL_GAMMU if you want to use Gammu.
