UPGRADE
-------
Upgrade to playSMS version 0.9.7.1 from unmodified playSMS version 0.9.6, bypasses playSMS version 0.9.7

Steps to upgrade:
1. Backup your old playSMS installation files, folders and database.
2. Move your old playSMS to another location (back it up)
3. Install this playSMS version (or extract it in the same path as old playSMS)
4. Copy old config.php from old playSMS to new playSMS config.php
5. Update database by inserting SQL patch file: 
    db/playsms-upgrade-096-to-0971.sql
    
    for example:
    # cd [this playSMS package directory]/db
    # mysql -u [database username] -p [old playSMS database name] < playsms-upgrade-096-to-0971.sql
