INSTALLATION on Linux
---------------------
playSMS Web Interface step-by-step installation:


1.  Create playSMS web root, spool and log and set ownership to user www-data or web server user

    # mkdir -p /var/www/playsms /var/spool/playsms /var/log/playsms

    # chown -R www-data /var/www/playsms /var/spool/playsms /var/log/playsms

    Note: There are Linux distributions using 'apache' as web server user instead of 'www-data'.


2.  Extract playSMS package somewhere (Usually in /usr/local/src).

    # tar -zxf playsms-x.x.x.tar.gz -C /usr/local/src

    # chown -R www-data /usr/local/src/playsms-x.x.x

    Note: x.x.x may vary according to the package name you've download.


3.  Setup database (import database)

    # mysqladmin -u root -p create playsms

    # mysql -u root -p playsms < /usr/local/src/playsms-x.x.x/db/playsms.sql

    Note: You don't need to use MySQL root access nor this method to setup playSMS
    database, but this is beyond our scope. You should read MySQL manual for custom
    installation method or howto insert SQL statements into existing database.


4.  Copy files and directories inside 'web' directory to playSMS web root and set ownership again to
    user www-data or web server user

    # cp -rR /usr/local/src/playsms-x.x.x/web/* /var/www/playsms


5.  Copy config-dist.php to config.php and then edit config.php

    # cp /var/www/playsms/config-dist.php /var/www/playsms/config.php

    # vi /var/www/playsms/config.php

    Note: Please read and fill all fields with correct values.


6.  Enter daemon/linux directory, copy playsms, playsmsd* and sendsmsd*

    # cp /usr/local/src/playsms-x.x.x/daemon/linux/etc/playsms /etc/default/

    # cp /usr/local/src/playsms-x.x.x/daemon/linux/bin/* /usr/local/bin/


7. Just to make sure every paths are correct, please edit /etc/default/playsms

    # vi /etc/default/playsms

    Note: Make sure that PLAYSMS_PATH is pointing to a correct playSMS installation path (in this example
    to /var/www/playsms), and also make sure that PLAYSMS_BIN is pointing to a correct playSMS daemon 
    scripts path (in this example to /usr/local/bin)


8. Look for rc.local on /etc and its subdirectories (usualy /etc, /etc/init.d or /etc/rc.d/init.d).
    If you found it then edit that rc.local and put:

    "/usr/local/bin/playsmsd_start" (without quotes)

    on the bottom of the file (before exit if theres an exit command). This way playsmsd_start
    will start automatically on boot.

    Note: Just like any other steps above you need 'root' access to do this.


9. Run playsmsd_start manually

    # /usr/local/bin/playsmsd_start

    Note:
    - after that please do a ps ax and see if playsmsd and sendsmsd are running

      # ps ax | grep sms
      2756 ?        S      0:00 /bin/bash ./playsmsd /var/www/playsms
      2759 ?        S      0:00 /bin/bash ./sendsmsd /var/www/playsms

    - stop here and review your installation steps when playsmsd and sendsmsd aren't running
    - consider to ask question in playSMS mailing list when you encountered any problem
    - if all seems to be correctly installed you may try to login from web

      browse http://localhost/playsms/ and login using default administrator user
      username: admin
      password: admin


Please continue to follow INSTALL_SMSSERVERTOOLS to use SMS Server Tools (smstools3) as your gateway
module, or follow INSTALL_KANNEL if you want to use Kannel instead.

Gnokii and Gammu also supported, please follow INSTALL_GNOKII if you want to use Gnokii as your
gateway module, or INSTALL_GAMMU if you want to use Gammu instead.

As of playSMS version 0.9.5 using Kannel or SMS Server Tools (smstools3) is preferrable.
