TRANSLATING PLAYSMS
--------------------

To create a new tranlation of playsms, you will have copy the translation for english
 to your destination language
For example, to translate from english (en_US) to catalan (ca_ES) you should do the
 following

cp -a plugin/language/en_US plugin/language/ca_ES

You will have to edit the following files:

 - docs/README #this is the readme document with the authors of the translations
 - LC_MESSAGES/message.po #is the file with the translations

Once you have translated the .po file into your language of choice, you have
 to convert the file into .mo (machine object), you can probably do it with
 any translation software, if you want you can do it from the command line
 by doing:

msgfmt messages.po

NOTE: 
The messages.po file will have to be in plugin/language/ca_ES/LC_MESSAGES/


UPDATE THE TRANSLATIONS
-----------------------

From time to time the translation strings have to be updated to reflect the
 new strings added to the interface, this process can be automated

Update the master .pot file with all the translations
1.- Go to the document root of your web installation
	cd /var/www/playsms
2.- Update the pot file with the updated strings
	find . -iname "*.php" -exec xgettext -j -o plugin/language/messages.pot {} \;
3.- Merge the updated .pot file with the existant translations (keeping the updated strings)
	cd plugin/language
	for i in `ls -1 | grep -v '\.'` ; do echo "msgmerge $i/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po messages.pot >$i/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po" ; done
4.- You can now translate the missing translations with you favourite editor and send them back
     to the developers so they can update the strings for the next version
